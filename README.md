The code contained in this repsitory was used for the final course project in AMATH 900 - Scientific Machine Learning at the University of Waterloo. The goal of this project was to replicate the key findings from the paper InverseSR: 3D Brain MRI Super-Resolution Using a Latent Diffusion Model by J. Wang et al. 

Bash scripts for submitting jobs to the University of Waterloo's HPC and GPU computing servers are found in the job_script directory. The primary scripts for running the latent diffusion model are found in the project directory.
